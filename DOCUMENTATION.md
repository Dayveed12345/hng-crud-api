## Known Limitations

- The API currently supports a maximum of 100 simultaneous connections. If your application experiences high traffic, consider implementing load balancing.

- Pagination for large result sets is not yet implemented. If your application expects large data sets, additional features may be required to handle pagination effectively.

- The API assumes that all incoming data is correctly formatted and validated on the client side. Proper input validation and error handling on the client are crucial to ensure the API functions as expected.

- Authentication and authorization mechanisms are not included in this API documentation. Depending on your application's security requirements, additional layers of security may need to be implemented.

- The API documentation may not cover all edge cases or specific use cases. It's essential to thoroughly test the API in your application's context and provide appropriate error handling and feedback to users.

- This API is built with performance in mind, but specific performance tuning and optimizations may be required based on the scale and complexity of your application. Monitor API performance in production and make adjustments as needed.

- Note that this API is subject to updates and improvements. Ensure you keep the API library up-to-date and follow any release notes or migration guides provided.


## Local Deployment

To deploy the API locally, follow these steps:

<!-- Visit  https://github.com/Dayveed12345/hng-crud-api/blob/main/README.md -->
### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- PHP (v8.3.0 or higher)
- Composer (v2.0.0 or higher)
- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher)
- PGSQL (v5.7.0 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dayveed12345/hng-crud-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd hng-crud-api
   ```

3. Install PHP dependencies using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. Install JavaScript dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and save it as `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

6. Generate an application key:

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

7. Open the `.env` file and configure your database connection settings.

### Running the API

1. Run database migrations to create the necessary database tables:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

   If your project includes seed data, you can also run database seeders:

   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

2. Start the Laravel development server:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```
   The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` by default.

## Using the CRUD API

You can use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with the CRUD API.

- **Create**: Use a POST request to create a new resource.
- **Read**: Use a GET request to retrieve one or more resources.
- **Update**: Use a PUT request to update an existing resource.
- **Delete**: Use a DELETE request to remove a resource.

Here are some example API endpoints:

- Create a new resource: `POST http://localhost:8000/api`
- Read all resources: `GET http://localhost:8000/api`
- Read a specific resource: `GET http://localhost:8000/api/{user_id}`
- Update a resource: `PUT http://localhost:8000/api/{user_id}`
- Delete a resource: `DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/{user_id}`
